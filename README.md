# NYC-Dog-Bites-n-Licenses
An exploratory analysis of a couple of data sets from NYC about dogs.

![staten](https://github.com/dariuskay/NYC-Dog-Bites-n-LIcenses/blob/master/images/staten%20island.png)


The first data set is of dog biting incidents from approximately January 2015-January 2018. The second is a set of dog licenses from approximately the same period.


I include analyses of breeds most likely to bite, name popularity and uniqueness, and most popular breeds.

Some vizzes are left unfinished but I think I did fairly well before getting bored. Enjoy!
